# Full-Stack Chat App using React (Firebase v9 - Next.js - Chakra UI)

A simple JavaScript chat app using Firebase authentication for Google sign-in and Firestore for database storage.

My first experience with full-stack development in JavaScript.

The app runs through [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
