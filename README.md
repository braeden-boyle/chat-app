# Full-Stack Chat App using React (Firebase v9 - Next.js - Chakra UI)

A simple JavaScript chat app using Firebase authentication for Google sign-in to enable message sending between Google accounts. Chat information and message history are stored through Firebase.

My first experience with full-stack development in JavaScript.

The app is currently not hosted.
